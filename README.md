**Predicting Neurological Recovery from Coma After Cardiac Arrest**

Objective: The goal of the 2023 Challenge is to use longitudinal EEG and ECG recordings to predict good and poor patient outcomes after cardiac arrest.

We ask participants to develop and deploy an open-source algorithm that can use basic clinical information and EEG and ECG recordings to predict the level of neurological recovery for cardiac arrest patients who present to the hospital in a coma. The winner of the Challenge will be the team whose algorithm achieves the highest prediction performance in the hidden test set.
